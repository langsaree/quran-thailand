# Software Method :

- Use Case Diagram 
- Data Flow Diagram
- Activity diagram
- Class Diagram


## Use Case Diagram :
A use case diagram is a visual representation of how users interact with the various systems that make up a larger system. The main goal of designing a use case diagram is to fully describe the system's functionality and to solicit user requests. This is regarded as where system analysis and design should begin.

## Data Flow Diagram :
A data flow diagram demonstrates the path that information takes through a system or process. It contains the numerous subprocesses the data flows through, data inputs and outputs, and data stores.

## Activity diagram :
Activity diagrams are a method for describing work flow, business processes, and procedural logic. They serve a similar purpose to flowcharts in many aspects, but the main distinction between the two is that they permit parallel behavior.

## Class Diagram :
Class diagrams are the blueprints of your system or subsystem. We can use class diagrams to model the objects that make up the system, to display the relationships between the objects, and to describe what those objects do and the services that they provide.
