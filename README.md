# Overview :

The Holy Quran is the most sacred book and the word of Allah that given to the prophet Muhammad through the angel Jibril, for the passed it on to his followers. So, the Quran is not a philosophy, poetry, literature, and sorcery, but is a warning from the Lord. The sublime language idioms of the Quran that makes a difference from any of the writings in the world, there is also a profound meaning in the Quranic verses containing questions, answers, warnings and challenges, which are incomparable and not to be  found in any other book in the world. 
The Holy Quran is the book that Allah guides humanity with a complete code of life. And the Quran teaches every aspect of human life which a person needs to know and study about . Being a Muslim, it is our belief that the learning of the Holy Quran is the primary and highly signified learning which is the solution to all problems and issues of our life. Allah(SWT) said :
كَمَآ أَرْسَلْنَا فِيكُمْ رَسُولًا مِّنكُمْ يَتْلُوا۟ عَلَيْكُمْ ءَايَـٰتِنَا وَيُزَكِّيكُمْ وَيُعَلِّمُكُمُ ٱلْكِتَـٰبَ وَٱلْحِكْمَةَ وَيُعَلِّمُكُم مَّا لَمْ تَكُونُوا۟ تَعْلَمُونَ
