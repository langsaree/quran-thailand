-What did you add and how?
So we have added a new section in The nobel-quraan website, Al-hadith section, we took the design from bootstrap card design, and also we requested around 20 hadiths for now” form the website using API with java script.
And we also added a card design for each hadith in both Arabic and English languages.

-Why we added this feature? 
Because we think Al-hadith completes al-quraan in a way that it explains it in more details, other wise we can’t fully understand al-quraan, also prophet Muhammad peace be upon him left us with two knowledge sources that we can never get lost if we take care of them and study, al-quraan and al-sunnah(hadith), we wanted to do more such as when the reader hovers with his mouse to the ayat in quraan, it shows him a hadith that is related to that ayah and take him directly to it with full explanation.
